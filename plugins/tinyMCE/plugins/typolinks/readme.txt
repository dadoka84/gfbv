This plugin extends the TinyMCE "add link" functionality by adding a
drop-down menu that allows you to browse the TYPOlight page tree. The
plugin is based on the "typolightlinks" plugin created by Andreas Gross,
however, it has been modified a lot to be compatible with the current
version of TinyMCE as well as the contextmenu plugin.
